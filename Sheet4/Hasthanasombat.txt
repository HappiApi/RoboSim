	Me and Daniel both tweaked on various versions of the wall follower which is eventually
used in the midterm task. There are various sections to the program, I implemented the function
used to calculate the position of the robot and draw a path while it is driving forward and back. 
Daniel implementedthe linked list and the function to follow the mapped line back.
